# Magnet Dudes

![](logo.png)


Magnet Dudes is a game created for the Mini Jame Gam #35. It is a speedrun puzzle game based off the themes switching dimensions and magnetism. As you progress through the game, you'll learn new techniques or mechanics that can help you in solving the puzzles for the following stages.

To download the game for yourself download this git repository and run the executable (Magnet Dudes).

## What comes next?

We wish to expand more upon this idea of the two dimensions and magnets by introducing more features and adding new and innovative stages for players to enjoy. Some ideas that have been brainstormed are more complicate mechanics like toggleable walls, buttons, magnetic objects that can push and pull. Our next goal is to implement buttons so red and blue can interact with each while across the map.
