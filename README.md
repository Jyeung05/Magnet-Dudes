# Magnet Dudes

![](logo.png)


Magnet Dudes is a game created for the Mini Jame Gam #35. It is a speedrun puzzle game with mechanics such as switching dimensions and magnetism. As you progress throught the game, you learn new techniques or mechanics that can help you in solving the puzzles to the next stages.

To download the game for yourself download this git repository and run the executable (Magnet Dudes).

## What comes next?

We wish to expand more upon this idea of the two dimensions and magnets by introducing more features and adding new and innovative stages for players to enjoy.
